# TODO List

- ~~integrate original functionality from Version 1~~
- option to have a banner and delay before redirection (global or on a link or
  user basis.) This banner should also display the actual link target.
- if user is banned, all their redirects should be unavailable
- ~~allow user to deactivate/reactivate own redirection. Admin can do for all~~
- User-friendly Front-end (probably in React) for adding and editing URLs.
- Custom URL key - allow user to use their own key instead of the autogenerated
  one. Once set it can't be changed later.
- delete all redirects for a specified user (Admin only)
